# Project 0

This is a simple website that talks a little bit about who I am, my education, and a couple of interests. Only **HTML** and **CSS** were used for this project.

## About me
    In this section I included a (very) small description of me, as well as a picture of myself.

## Art
    In this section I talk a little bit about when I got into drawing and painting, as well as include pictures of drawings and recent paintings.

## Passtime
    In this section I mention my hobby: videogames. I mention which platforms I play on the most and playtime of some of the games I play; formatted as a table.

## Studies
    In this section I say where and what I'm studying. I included some of the courses relevant to the Bachelor's in a list, and marked which of them I'm taking and which I haven't taken yet. (everything else I've taken)

## Other
    Each of the HTML files include the code for the header (which I know from my experiencde with Angular that there is a way to combine HTMLs, so as to not repeat code). The project also includes a stylesheet written in sass, which is translated into CSS. Many selectors and properties were used, as well as a media-responsive query to alter text in the art page. There's also an image file containing all the images used in the website.
