                        I knew I had the talent ever since I was 4 years old, when I realized I was able to draw my favorite cartoon 
                        character pretty well. It wasnt untill I was 15 that I decided to explore more styles and to draw different 
                        things. Now, 7 years later, I still struggle slighly with face proportions and positioning elements in space, 
                        but I've definitely improved a lot since then. These two drawings were drawn four years ago.

                    It wasn't until this year, where I forced myself to take a painting class, that I truly got comfortable with a paint 
                    brush. These two are some of the paintings I've done as class assignments.
